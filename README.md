# Data-Preprocessing-for-Startup-Prediction

## Project Description
A machine learning project that analyzes Crunchbase startup data to predict whether companies will get acquired/closed (0) or stay operating/IPO (1). Features data cleaning, feature engineering, and binary classification.

 ## Key Features
- Data Cleaning: Handles missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies
- Feature Engineering: Creates meaningful features like company age and funding metrics
- Binary Classification: Predicts Active_Status (0 = Acquired/Closed, 1 = Operating/IPO)
- Reproducible Pipeline: Jupyter Notebook + Python script for easy reuse

## Dataset
Source: Crunchbase (companies_new.csv)
Size: 52,000+ startup records
Features: Funding amounts, founding dates, categories, locations, etc.

## Tech Stack

Python (Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn)
Jupyter Notebook for analysis
GitHub for version control

## Project Goals

Preprocess raw startup data into ML-ready format
Engineer predictive features (e.g., funding trends)
Predict acquisition likelihood using classification models

## Conclusion

This project transforms raw Crunchbase startup data into actionable insights by cleaning, feature engineering, and creating a binary `Active_Status` target (0=acquired/closed, 1=operating/IPO). The pipeline delivers analysis-ready datasets and reproducible code to predict startup outcomes. These results empower investors and founders to make data-driven decisions about company trajectories.
